# NASA SpaceApps 2025 (Ottawa)

## Project Overview
This repository is my submission for the 2025 NASA SpaceApps hackathon, for the following challenge.

**Challenge** : NASA Farm Navigators: Using NASA Data Exploration in Agriculture

Before describing the project, let's outline the goals of this project:

1. The primary objective is to educate and be illustrative.
2. The secondary objective is for the gameplay to map cleanly to existing data sets.
3. The tertiary objective (stretch goal) is for the game to be based entirely on real-world data.
